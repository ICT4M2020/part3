                    at <a href="https://www.easychair.org/"><strong style="color: blue">easychair.</strong></a></p>
                    <p>Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published or that
                    are simultaneously submitted to a <a href="https://academicjournals.org/"><u style="color: blue"><strong>journal</strong></u></a>

                    Submitted papers will be peer-reviewed and carefully evaluated based on originality,

                    <p>The submitted papers must be between 4-6 pages. To facilitate the paper's double-blind peer
                    review process, authors should make efforts to ensure that information about the authors' identities
                    do not appear anywhere in the text-body of the paper and must follow the guidelines.</p>

                    <p>Upon acceptance, at least one of the authors listed in the paper must submit the final paper, attend the
                    conference and present the paper according to the schedule of the conference. In the event that the presenter
                    is unable to attend the conference for any reasons, your accepted paper will not be considered for submission
                    of the proceeding to the <strong>IEEE Xplore.</strong></p>

                    <p>Accepted papers after further revisions will be invited for publications in selected journals.
